 # Design Document: Refactoring Legacy code for 2019 

This document is intended to look at the differences between solidity documentation from 2018 to 2019 and incorporating Open-Zeppelin's battle tested codeBase.

We agreed that we would utilize the battle tried Open-Zeppelin ERC721 & ERC721Enumerable contracts as our base contracts and build the proprietary MemeMerchant code around this base. This greatly simplifies the effort and increases confidence in both functionality and security of the contracts. Additionally, it streamlines testing efforts
